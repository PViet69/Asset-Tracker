# OpenAI-Compatible File Embeddings

FastAPI service that accepts text, image, and PDF uploads, runs each image through a configurable vision-language model that returns a structured image description, embeds that description (or the raw text) via a configured text-embedding model, and stores the resulting vectors in Qdrant. Image points also store a payload with the filename, MIME type, and description text for vector search. Raw vectors are never returned.

## Pipeline at a glance

```
upload ─▶ MIME detect ─▶ text/PDF? ─▶ raw text ─┐
                  │                              ├─▶ text embedding ─▶ Qdrant
                  └─ PNG/JPEG/WEBP? ─▶ structured description ─▶ formatted text ─┘
```

- Images (PNG/JPEG/WEBP) are sent to `DESCRIPTION_MODEL` via Instructor (JSON mode) and validated into a Pydantic `ImageDescription`. The description is converted into a deterministic multi-section string and embedded through `EMBEDDING_MODEL`.
- Text and PDF content is embedded directly through `EMBEDDING_MODEL`. PDFs use text extraction only.
- All vectors live in a single shared collection. Image and text vectors share the same embedding space.

## Local development

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `uv`
- `libmagic`
- Running Qdrant instance
- Running OpenAI-compatible endpoint that exposes both the vision-language model (`DESCRIPTION_MODEL`) and the text-embedding model (`EMBEDDING_MODEL`)

Install dependencies and copy configuration:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL`, `DESCRIPTION_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `QDRANT_URL`, and `QDRANT_VECTOR_SIZE`. Start the app:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.app.main:create_app --factory --reload
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL` | Yes | None | OpenAI-compatible base URL for the text-embedding model. |
| `MODEL_ENDPOINT_API_KEY` | No | Empty | Embedding endpoint API key. |
| `MODEL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | No | `30` | Model request timeout in seconds. |
| `DESCRIPTION_MODEL` | Yes | None | Vision-language model used to generate structured image descriptions (PNG/JPEG/WEBP). |
| `DESCRIPTION_ENDPOINT_URL` | Yes | None | OpenAI-compatible base URL for the description model. May differ from `MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL`. |
| `DESCRIPTION_ENDPOINT_API_KEY` | No | Empty | Description endpoint API key. |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Yes | None | Text-embedding model used for description text, raw text, and PDF text. |
| `UPLOAD_API_KEY` | No | Empty | Bearer key required for file uploads. When unset, uploads are accepted from loopback clients only. |
| `QDRANT_URL` | Yes | None | Qdrant URL. |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | No | Empty | Qdrant API key. |
| `QDRANT_COLLECTION` | No | `file_embeddings` | Qdrant collection name. |
| `QDRANT_VECTOR_SIZE` | Yes | None | Vector size; must match `EMBEDDING_MODEL` output. |
| `QDRANT_DISTANCE` | No | `Cosine` | Qdrant distance metric used when creating the collection. |
| `SEARCH_THRESHOLD` | No | None | Minimum cosine similarity (0–1) for `/v1/search` hits. Search is unavailable when unset. |

At startup, the app checks the configured Qdrant collection and creates it when missing using the configured vector size and distance metric.

## Docker Compose

Docker Desktop with Compose can run the app plus Qdrant:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

When the model API runs on the Docker Desktop host, set `MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8001/v1`. In other environments, use a URL reachable from the app container. Compose connects the app to Qdrant using service DNS.

`docker compose down` preserves the named `qdrant_storage` volume. `docker compose down -v` deletes local Qdrant data.

## Create file embeddings

`POST /v1/file-embeddings` accepts multipart form data with repeated `files` fields:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/file-embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPLOAD_API_KEY" \
  -F files=@README.md \
  -F files=@photo.png
```

The response contains one result per uploaded file:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "filename": "README.md",
      "content_type": "text/markdown",
      "status": "success",
      "reason": null
    },
    {
      "filename": "bad.bin",
      "content_type": "application/octet-stream",
      "status": "failed",
      "reason": "Unsupported file type"
    }
  ]
}
```

Public items contain filename, content type, status (`success` or `failed`), and a safe reason when failed. Embedding vectors, Qdrant point IDs, image descriptions, image bytes, API keys, tracebacks, and local paths are never returned.

### Supported content

Type detection uses file bytes through `python-magic`; filename extensions do not determine type.

- UTF-8 text: `text/plain`, `text/csv`, `text/markdown`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, `text/yaml`, `text/x-yaml`, `text/html`, `text/css`, and `text/x-*`
- Images: PNG, JPEG, WEBP — routed through the description pipeline
- PDFs: text extraction only — routed through the text embedding path

Scanned PDFs are unsupported because OCR is out of scope.

### Limits and errors

- Maximum 10 files per request
- Maximum 25 MB per file
- Maximum 250 MB aggregate request body
- Images exceeding 100 million pixels are rejected
- Uploads require `Authorization: Bearer $UPLOAD_API_KEY` when configured, and are rate-limited to 60 requests per minute per client address
- Missing files or more than 10 files return HTTP 400
- Empty, oversized, unsupported, invalid, model-failed, or storage-failed files return per-file errors with HTTP 200 when the request itself is valid

## Vector search

`POST /v1/search` embeds the query text with the configured `EMBEDDING_MODEL` and returns stored vectors scoring at or above `SEARCH_THRESHOLD`, ordered by similarity. Results come from image points carrying a payload with the upload filename, MIME type, and stored description text. Text/PDF points and legacy payload-less points are excluded from results.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPLOAD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"a red sports car","limit":10}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "point_id": "3f2b...",
      "score": 0.87,
      "filename": "photo.png",
      "file_path": "photos/2026/photo.png",
      "file_type": "image/png",
      "content": "Description text..."
    }
  ]
}
```

- `query` must be a single non-blank string (max 8192 characters).
- `limit` is optional, default 10, valid range 1–100.
- `SEARCH_THRESHOLD` must be set before calling this endpoint; when unset the endpoint returns HTTP 503 with `{"detail":"Search is not configured"}`.
- Requires the same bearer auth and rate limit as uploads.

## Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Healthy response:

```json
{"status":"ok","qdrant":"ok","model":"ok"}
```

The `model` field reports `ok` only when both `DESCRIPTION_MODEL` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL` are reachable from the configured endpoint. The overall status becomes `degraded` when any of the three dependencies (description, embedding, Qdrant) reports unavailable.

## Privacy

- Image bytes leave the app only as part of the description request to `MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL`.
- Image descriptions are persisted as Qdrant point payloads (alongside the upload filename and MIME type) so search results can surface them.
- Text/PDF vectors are stored without payloads.
- API responses never expose raw vectors, API keys, tracebacks, or local paths.

## Security

File uploads require `UPLOAD_API_KEY` bearer authentication (when configured) and use in-memory per-client rate limiting (60 requests/min). Aggregate request bodies are bounded at 250 MB. Compose publishes app and Qdrant ports on loopback by default. Keep services behind trusted/private networks or an authenticated gateway in production.

For production deployments behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx, Traefik, Caddy, or AWS ALB), enforce ingress request body limits (such as Nginx `client_max_body_size 250m;`) to bound chunked uploads before body spooling occurs at the ASGI application server level.

Health checks use low-cost model listing and do not submit embedding or description requests.
